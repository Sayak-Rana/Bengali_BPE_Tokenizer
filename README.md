## Files in this repository

- **`Bengali_BPE_Assign1.ipynb`**  
  - Used to load the Bengali corpus.  
  - Implement the BPE algorithm from scratch.  
  - Train the tokenizer.  
  - Save the trained model files (`.merges.txt` and `.vocab.json`).  

- **`streamlit_bengali_bpe.py`**  
  - Streamlit application file.  
  - Loads the trained model files.  
  - Provides a text box interface to test tokenization of Bengali sentences.
